		<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>I'm Killua Zoldyck. I come from a family of assassins. Unlike my
			family, however, I do not wish to be an assassin. I want my life to
			mean more than killing and getting paid. Besides, it's too easy.</p>

			<p>I decided to go to the Hunters' Exam for a challenge and to get
			out of the house. Along the way, I met a kid about my age (12). It's
			rare for me to find people my age with the amount of skills I have,
			and after talking for a while during the first phase of the exam,
			we started to become friends-- a hard thing to come by for assassins.
			</p>

			<p>That was when I realized what I most wanted in this world: a friend.
			It wasn't long until we became just that. After the exam,
			we traveled the world, and mostly I tagged along, but I didn't mind;
			being there with him was enough for me. Not only did we physically
			grow stronger and learn <a href="https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/
			Killua_Zoldyck#Abilities_&_Powers" target="_blank">super cool fighting 
			techniques</a>, but we grew to know each other. I'm just glad that I
			didn't turn out how my family wanted, and now I can live a life knowing
			what having someone you care about is like.</p>
